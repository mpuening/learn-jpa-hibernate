## TL;DR Active Record Library Example HOW-TO

This project exercises the active record library. Both `Student` and `Course` are active 
records and there are not any spring repositories in this project.

This project's `pom.xml` file includes the `aspectj-maven-plugin` plugin to use an aspectj
library.

Remember, Lombok is not compatible with Aspectj at the time this was written.
